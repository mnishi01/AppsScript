# AppsScript
This is a repository for Apps Script functions to work with Google Sheets

The Test functions were created to check if the core functions (the ones that receive parameters) work.
For this, it is necessary that the file contains the following sheets:
- Main
- Sheet1
- Sheet2
- Template
- Parms
